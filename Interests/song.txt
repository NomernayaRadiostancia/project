Feel no shame about shape
Weather changes their phrase
Even mother will show you another way
So put your glasses on
Nothing will be wrong
There's no blame, there's no fame
It's up to you, the first words should be finded
Whatever holds you back, I can, I can get it off

Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you want
I don't know why, don't know why, don't know why you afraid
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what you say
I don't know why, don't know why, too late, it's too late
